Installation of Regnum (formerly MUD4TLD)
=========================================

NOTE: You will need a C compiler installed. Any Unix/Linux distro should already have one, so you should be good to go. You will also need SQLite3 installed, as well as the library and header files. This is essential. I also highly recommend the "screen" program, or similar, to be installed if you want to run the WHOIS server.

The Interface:

	[1] By whatever method applies to your Linux distribution or FreeBSD, install a web server with PHP support if you have not already done so.
		I recommend lighttpd or nginx with PHP5, but it is up to you.

	[2] At the command line (change the uppercase TLD to your specified TLD below):
		sqlite3 TLD_tld.sq3 < OZ_tld.sql

	[3] Copy TLD_tld.sq3 to where the PHP files are. Make sure all files are read-write capable and owner and group are whatever the web server software/daemon is running under.
		You might also want to ensure that group read-write is set on the DB, otherwise you will get errors.
		
	[5] If you are using MySQL you need to set the AUTO_INCREMENT attribute in id fields of tables users and registrars

[5] Access index.php with your browser and it should all be set. Change your TLD in conf.php to make it apply throughout your site. Adjust and change the rest as necessary.


The WHOIS server:

[1] At the command line,

gcc -o wit_server wit_server.c -lsqlite3

[2] Make sure a copy of the above DB is in the same directory.

[3] Now, as root, create a new "screen" session and run

wit_server

The WHOIS server is now running.


Initialise the TLD/Generate the ZONE file.

This is seen in init_tld/make_live.sh. This script shows how to check to see if a change needs to be made, re-generates the zone file using your TLD operator details and then reloads BIND. This script can be run as a cron job to automate this process. I recommend every 5-15 minutes, but whatever you prefer is fine.
